Documentation of the different datasets in *original_data*.

In the original data section we stored the raw data files which will be manipulated in our python codes. These should not be manipulated and saved in the same folder as it would hamper project reproducibility. 
4 file exist in our folder. All are state files which are readable in python

Along with this I have put an image taken which we generated later using our analysis. The original format was in graphviz dot file. In the figure code file I imported the image from this folder and exported it to the out_figures folder using the codes in final python file.
