Descriptive Stats and Decision Tree
=================

.. automodule:: src.final.Descriptive
    :members:

The code builds different plots for the data used and give the statistics. We have generated 3 plots using the seaborn and matplotlib python libraries. 
We imported our dataset and exported all our images in the out_figures folder. 
We generated one bar chart, one combined image of density plots. We also exported our decision tree image to this folder from the original data folder to keep all our generated images at one place.
